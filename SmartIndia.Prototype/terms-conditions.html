                                            Virtual classrooms like any other classroom have limited capacity.
                                            Demand for our classes is very high, and late cancellation may prevent other students from obtaining a spot in our classes.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            Students who terminate enrolment to their package of Virtual Classroom lessons are entitled to a partial refund of the overall tuition for that package as per the following stipulations:
                                        </p>
                                        <ul class="pri-ul">

                                            <li>Cancellation after the 7 days from the date of purchase and before the 1st scheduled Virtual Classroom lesson no refund can be made.</li>
                                            <li>Cancellation after the 1st Scheduled Classroom lesson no refund can be made.</li>

                                        <p>
                                            The above-mentioned refunds are the only ones that will be given to those who decide to cancel a Virtual Classroom course.

                                            Nomination by the client of an alternative learner for a course may be made at any time up to the course start date.
                                            The fee for making this change is £150 per learner substitution in order to cover administrative expenses.

                                            It is the client’s responsibility to ensure that the learner(s) receive all the relevant information including the joining instructions and that they meet the eligibility and published prerequisite requirements.
